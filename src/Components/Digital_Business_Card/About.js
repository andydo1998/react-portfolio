                Hi! My name is Andy. I grew up as an only child and am a first generation student.
                I was lucky enough to be able to get the opportunity to attend a four year university
                and through hard work and determination, I was able to graduate from University
                of California, San Diego. From very early on, my parents saved up enough money to be able
                to afford our first computer. This starts my obsession with computers, as I was fascinated
                with how many components were part of a computer, as well as how they all connect to
                present us with a much more simpler user interface. At this point, I knew that I would
                have a career in technology.
